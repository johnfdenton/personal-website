        Beyond classroom teaching and professional development, I contribute to school-wide planning and strategic decision-making through committee work, accreditation processes, and budget management.

          <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
            Participated in school-wide initiatives focused on elevating academic programs and teaching practices across all divisions.

          <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
            Served on math, science, and STEM committees preparing for accreditation renewal. Contributed to self-study documentation, program evaluation, and strategic planning for curricular improvements.

          <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
            Collaborated with lower, middle, and upper school faculty to ensure STEM curriculum progression creates a coherent learning arc. Identified gaps and redundancies, designed transition points between divisions, and aligned learning outcomes to create cumulative skill development.

    <!-- Budget Management & Strategic Resource Allocation -->

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-primary-400 mb-6">Budget Management & Strategic Resource Allocation</h2>
      <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Managed the Educational Technology budget for the middle school, making strategic decisions about tool adoption and resource allocation. Responsibilities included:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-neutral-300 space-y-3 ml-4">
        <li class="leading-relaxed">
          Evaluating new technology requests from faculty, weighing pedagogical value against cost and considering alternatives that might better serve learning goals.
        </li>
        <li class="leading-relaxed">
          Identifying more economical or higher-quality options when existing tools underperformed or became cost-prohibitive.
        </li>
        <li class="leading-relaxed">
          Managing subscription renewals and sunsetting outdated platforms that no longer aligned with instructional needs.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed mt-6">
        This work required balancing faculty requests with budgetary constraints, maintaining awareness of emerging tools and market changes, and ensuring technology spending directly supported teaching and learning rather than accumulating unused licenses.

    <!-- Systems-Level Problem Solving -->
    <div class="bg-neutral-800 rounded-lg p-8 border border-neutral-700 shadow-lg mb-8">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-primary-400 mb-6">Systems-Level Problem Solving</h2>
      <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
        I approach challenges from a systems perspective, considering how decisions impact multiple stakeholders and how solutions can scale beyond individual classrooms. Whether designing school-wide tools like the Read-a-Thon tracker, coordinating multi-divisional curriculum alignment, or managing technology resources, I focus on sustainable solutions that serve the broader school community.
