    <!-- Introduction -->
    <div class="bg-neutral-800 rounded-lg p-8 border border-neutral-700 shadow-lg mb-8">
      <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Over six years as Educational Technology Integrator, I've trained 40+ faculty members through a combination of large-scale workshops and individualized coaching. My approach prioritizes pedagogically grounded technology integration where tools serve learning goals rather than drive them.
      </p>
      <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
        <strong class="text-neutral-100">Philosophy:</strong> Sustainable technology integration requires more than one-off training. I build faculty capacity through workshops that establish foundational understanding, followed by job-embedded coaching and collaborative planning when teachers request support for specific curricular goals.

    <!-- Approach & Impact -->
    <div class="bg-neutral-800 rounded-lg p-8 border border-neutral-700 shadow-lg mb-8">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-primary-400 mb-6">Approach & Impact</h2>
      <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        My professional development work emphasizes building teacher confidence and autonomy. I create resources that enable faculty to troubleshoot independently, design training that addresses teachers at different comfort levels with technology, and maintain follow-up support to ensure initiatives sustain beyond initial implementation.
      </p>
      <p class="text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed">
        The goal is always faculty empowerment. When teachers see technology as a tool they can shape to their pedagogical vision rather than an external requirement to adopt, integration becomes organic and purposeful.
