          About Me
        </h2>
        <div class="text-neutral-300 space-y-4 leading-relaxed">
          <p>
            I'm an educational technologist and instructional designer with 18 years of teaching experience, specializing in faculty development, technology integration, and innovative curriculum design.
          </p>
          <p>
            As an Educational Technology Integrator, I've trained a faculty of over 40 members on instructional technology tools and led professional development initiatives on remote and hybrid learning modalities. I work at the intersection of pedagogy and technology, helping educators leverage digital tools to create more engaging, accessible, and effective learning experiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            My current work as Head Coding and Robotics Teacher focuses on developing connected, scaffolded curricula that build computational thinking and problem-solving skills. I design learning experiences where students don't just consume technology but become creators and innovators.
          </p>
          <p>
            With an M.Ed. in Educational Technology and Instructional Design, I bring expertise in backward design, differentiated instruction, assessment for learning, and Universal Design for Learning principles developed through years of working with diverse learners in specialized educational settings.
          </p>
          <p>
            My work spans educational game development, physical computing projects, professional development design, and building sustainable technology integration programs that empower both students and educators.
