        <p>
          Education thrives at the intersection of curiosity and challenge. I believe learning should be student-centered, interdisciplinary, and grounded in real-world application. These principles drive my approach to both classroom instruction and technology integration.
        </p>
        <p>
          My philosophy centers on two commitments: <strong class="text-neutral-100">empowering student agency</strong> and <strong class="text-neutral-100">designing for authentic problem-solving</strong>. I create learning environments where students actively construct knowledge, where technology serves as a tool for creation, and where every learner's strengths are recognized and developed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having worked in a specialized learning environment serving students with learning differences, I've learned that effective differentiation and Universal Design for Learning principles benefit all students. Flexibility, multiple entry points, and scaffolded support represent best practices for any classroom. This approach reflects my commitment to equity: ensuring every student has access to rigorous, meaningful learning experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm passionate about inquiry-based learning that connects classroom work to community impact and global citizenship. Whether students are coding solutions to real problems, building robots to explore STEM concepts, or collaborating across disciplines, learning should feel purposeful and relevant. Technology amplifies these opportunities when integrated thoughtfully, responsibly, and with clear pedagogical intent.

          I design coding and robotics curricula that balance technical skill development with creative problem-solving and collaborative learning. My approach emphasizes <strong class="text-neutral-100">computational thinking</strong> and <strong class="text-neutral-100">iterative design</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          My 6th through 8th grade robotics curriculum creates a connected, scaffolded progression using the Birdbrain Learning platform. In 6th grade, students master outputs with Finch robots, learning to control motors, lights, and sounds while building foundational programming concepts. The 7th grade curriculum builds on this foundation by incorporating inputs and greater processing complexity with the same Finch robots, where students integrate sensors and make decisions based on environmental data. By 8th grade, students graduate to the more open-ended Hummingbird kits, designing and building unique robotic systems that solve engineering problems and complete creative coding challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout this progression, students apply the scientific method to their coding practice. They learn to change one variable at a time, test results systematically, and analyze outcomes before making additional modifications. This disciplined approach to debugging and iteration develops both computational thinking and scientific reasoning skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          Separately, my game development curriculum uses Code.org's Game Lab to teach interactive design and programming logic. I've created demonstration games like "UniCat," "SpaceLazerz," and "Coffee vs Nap" that serve as jumping-off points. Students examine functional code, figure out how it works, and make iterative changes to test their understanding and make the game their own. These projects integrate sprite animation, collision detection, scoring systems, and user input while giving students ownership over their creative vision.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe coding education should be inclusive and creative. Students learn programming fundamentals through projects that matter to them. Assessment focuses on growth, iteration, and process. I prioritize debugging skills, collaborative troubleshooting, and the ability to articulate design decisions, preparing students for a future where adaptability and creative thinking matter as much as technical knowledge.

          Technology integration should be purposeful, pedagogically sound, and equitable. Over six years as Educational Technology Integrator, I trained 40+ faculty members on instructional technology tools and led professional development on remote and hybrid learning modalities, always grounding tech adoption in learning outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
          My approach emphasizes <strong class="text-neutral-100">faculty empowerment</strong> and <strong class="text-neutral-100">accessible design</strong>. I support teachers in selecting and implementing tools that enhance learning, whether collaborative platforms, formative assessment tools, multimedia creation software, or learning management systems. I'm Google for Education certified and experienced with diverse ed tech ecosystems, including 1:1 device programs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Working in a specialized learning environment serving students with learning differences has deepened my expertise in assistive technology. I've implemented and supported tools for text-to-speech, speech-to-text, graphic organizers, executive function support, and alternative input methods. Universal Design for Learning principles guide my work: proactive accessibility benefits all learners, and technology can remove barriers when thoughtfully deployed.

          Leading the integration of AI and emerging technologies requires balancing innovation with ethical responsibility. I approach AI literacy as a core competency for both students and faculty, one that supports critical thinking, problem-solving, and creating in authentic contexts while maintaining a strong foundation in ethical leadership.
        </p>
        <p>
          My work with AI in education focuses on two areas: developing responsible use frameworks and professional development that connects AI tools to pedagogy. I help faculty distinguish between uses that enhance learning and those that might undermine essential skill development, while creating opportunities for students to understand both the capabilities and limitations of these technologies. I believe students should learn to use AI constructively, evaluating its outputs critically and understanding the ethical implications of algorithmic decision-making.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've led faculty through explorations of generative AI tools, helping them distinguish between uses that enhance learning and those that might undermine essential skill development. This includes creating guidelines for transparent AI use, designing assignments that leverage AI productively while maintaining academic integrity, and fostering conversations about digital citizenship in an AI-augmented world.
        </p>
        <p>
          For emerging technologies more broadly, I maintain systems for vetting new tools for compliance, safety, and pedagogical value, while also recognizing when to sunset outdated platforms. I collaborate with technical teams to ensure educational technology initiatives align with infrastructure capabilities and with curriculum leaders to ensure tools serve learning goals rather than drive them.

          Effective instructional design balances rigorous learning goals with engaging experiences that meet diverse learner needs. My M.Ed. in Educational Technology and Instructional Design (2025) formalized expertise I've developed through years of curriculum development, faculty training, and creating educational resources.
        </p>
        <p>
          I design learning experiences using <strong class="text-neutral-100">backward design principles</strong>: start with clear outcomes, determine meaningful assessments, then craft instruction that bridges the gap. Whether developing full course sequences like my 6th through 8th grade robotics curriculum, creating assessment tools for students performing below grade level, or building digital learning modules, I prioritize alignment between objectives, activities, and evaluation.
        </p>
        <p>
          My instructional design work spans multiple modalities: synchronous and asynchronous learning, project-based experiences, blended learning environments, and game-based approaches. I've developed professional development programs for faculty, created interactive learning resources, and designed assessment rubrics that provide actionable feedback.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm particularly interested in <strong class="text-neutral-100">interdisciplinary design</strong> that connects learning across content areas and <strong class="text-neutral-100">assessment for learning</strong> that reflects real-world applications. Technology serves as both tool and catalyst, enabling personalized learning paths, facilitating collaboration, providing immediate feedback, and creating opportunities for multimodal expression.
        </p>
        <p>
          Effective instructional design requires iteration and responsiveness. I collect learner feedback, analyze performance data, and refine experiences based on evidence. This approach treats curriculum as evolving rather than fixed, ensuring learning experiences remain relevant, rigorous, and engaging.
